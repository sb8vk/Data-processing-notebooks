# Collection of executable notebooks exploring data science & ML.

---

## Overview 
This repository contains hands-on guides, reproducible notebooks, and short technical notes for myself as I explore GPU-accelerated data science. 

> Goal: exploring how to make smarter tool choices and understand where GPUs can materially improve workload performance.

---

## What you’ll find here 
- — Executable, small-focus notebooks that demonstrate end-to-end patterns.
- — Long-form guides and how-tos.
- — Scripts and raw results for reproducing them.

## Quick start 
1. Check GPU and drivers:

```bash
# Verify driver & basic GPU health
nvidia-smi
# Confirm CUDA toolkit on PATH
nvcc --version
```
